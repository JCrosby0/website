      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I love solutions.</p>
      <p>I like data, logic, bringing order to chaos, automation. I love consuming technology to achieve this.</p>
      <p>As a Petrophysicist, I was the focal point for data acquisition: communicating with interested parties to plan and execute the operations to acquire the data needed to evaluate an oil or gas reservoir. As an end-user, I used software to collate, visualise and calculate my data. I augmented that software to improve its performance, streamline data loading and automate workflows. </p>
      <p>I've always been building solutions. Now I'm building web applications.</p>
